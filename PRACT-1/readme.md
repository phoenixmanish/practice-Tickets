This is a simple Flask web application that runs a server and displays "Hello, World!" on port 8080. To set it up, install Flask using pip install flask, create a Python file named app.py, and add the necessary Flask code to define a route that returns "Hello, World!". Running python app.py will start the application, making it accessible on http://localhost:8080 from the local machine or via http://YOUR-IP:8080/ for other devices on the same network.
